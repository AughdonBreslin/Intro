# Intro

Welcome to my github page! A lot of my repos involve classwork and so are set to private. If you would like to see anything from my school projects, you can email me at abreslin@stevens.edu. Other than that, here are a few of my projects that I have organized together, and I am continuing to organize some other projects before I upload them as well. 

My personal favorite is my Connect Four AI; it was definitely the most fun to show my highschool teacher and display it in showcases, as well as to have kids challenge it at varying depths!

Hope you enjoy!
